### Application functions

The myFlix app provides a collection of movies that can be viewed by registered users. User data is also stored in a collection and API calls are made

### Setting up the tools:

First, install Parcel globally. This is the bundler that is used to bundle the application and make it accessible in your browser.

In your terminal, type:

```
$ npm install --global parcel@next
```


You can now download the repository to your computer and install the necessary modules by running:

```
$ npm install
```

### Start the application

To start the development server, type the following in your terminal:

```
$ parcel src/index.html
```

the path to index.html is supposed to be put behind the parcel command, in this case _parcel src/index.html_

or

```
$ npm run dev
```

The console shows you the port on which the application is rendered. If your browser doesn't open automatically, open it manually and navigate to the URL given in the terminal, in most cases: http://localhost:3000
